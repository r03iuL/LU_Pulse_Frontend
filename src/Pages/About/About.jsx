          <p className="text-lg border-t-4 border-slate-300 py-4">
            LU Pulse is a comprehensive and innovative notification system developed specifically for university students, faculty, and administrative staff. It aims to streamline communication across the campus by providing real-time updates on important notices, events, and activities. Whether it&apos;s an academic deadline, a campus event, or administrative announcements, LU Pulse ensures everyone stays informed and connected.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Our platform serves as a unified hub for all notices, helping the university community remain organized and up-to-date. Additionally, LU Pulse offers seamless calendar integration, making it easier for users to manage their schedules by syncing upcoming events directly to their personal or university-provided calendars. By centralizing university communications, LU Pulse fosters a well-informed campus environment.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2 text-orange-600">Why LU Pulse?</h2>
          <p className="text-lg border-t-4 border-slate-300 py-4">
            Unlike WhatsApp groups or Facebook pages, LU Pulse is tailored specifically for the needs of a university environment. While social media platforms and messaging apps are great for casual communication, they lack the structure and reliability that an official notification system provides.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg">
            <li><strong>Centralized and Official:</strong> LU Pulse is the official notification platform for the university, ensuring that all notices are accurate and timely. No more digging through long WhatsApp threads or missing important updates in a crowded Facebook feed.</li>
            <li><strong>No Distractions:</strong> Unlike social media groups, LU Pulse is dedicated solely to university notices and events, without the distractions of unrelated conversations and content that fill other platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> LU Pulse delivers real-time updates that are crucial for academic deadlines, campus events, and administrative announcements. You donâ€™t have to rely on someone to forward or repost the information.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> Automatically sync important dates and events to your calendar with LU Pulse, a feature that social media groups lack, ensuring you never miss any deadlines.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> LU Pulse is designed with privacy and access control in mind, making sure only authorized users (students, faculty, and staff) can access and interact with the information.</li>
          </ul>
